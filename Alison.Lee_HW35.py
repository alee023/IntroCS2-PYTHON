"""
Mechanism for Madlibification:
    Have word[randrange(len(word))] run everytime a word needs
to be inputed. We would have lists with nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs,
and each time one needed to be called, we would have a random index found,
and therefore a random word is chosen from the list. We would then have it
printed. The input for the function is the number of nouns, verbs, adjectives,
and adverbs.
